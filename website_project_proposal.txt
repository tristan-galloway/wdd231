My idea is to have a webpage that will display info about video games. I chose this subject just because I enjoy video gaming and would like to have a website built around the hobby. Following is the general info brainstormed so far.

Gaming Hub
Pages:
	Homepage: Display trending games.
	Game Details: Information about a specific game.
	Favorites: Track your favorite games.
API: RAWG Video Games Database
